## Kaggle-query

### purpose

make it cool and interesting to find a dataset for my next data project

### notes

current state: picks a random dataset and returns some attributes (like title and subtitle)

next steps:

- add a filter for size e.g. don't allow extremely large datasets to be returned (or make the size a parameter that can be set by the user)
- allow the user to describe the kind of project they want to do, and comb through the dataset descriptions on kaggle to find an appropriate short-list of matches.
- download the dataset if the user accepts it. 
- automatically create a new folder with a git repository for the dataset
